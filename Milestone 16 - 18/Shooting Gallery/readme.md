Project of milestone 16 - 18

Not ready yet

Challenge
It’s time to put your skills to the test and make your own app, starting from a blank canvas. This time your challenge is to make a shooting gallery game using SpriteKit: create three rows on the screen, then have targets slide across from one side to the other. If the user taps a target, make it fade out and award them points.

How you implement this game really depends on what kind of shooting gallery games you’ve played in the past, but here are some suggestions to get you started:

Make some targets big and slow, and others small and fast. The small targets should be worth more points.
Add “bad” targets – things that cost the user points if they get shot accidentally.
Make the top and bottom rows move left to right, but the middle row move right to left.
Add a timer that ticks down from 60 seconds. When it hits zero, show a Game Over message.
Try going to https://openclipart.org/ to see what free artwork you can find.
Give the user six bullets per clip. Make them tap a different part of the screen to reload.
