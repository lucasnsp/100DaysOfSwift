Project 24 


Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

Create a String extension that adds a withPrefix() method. If the string already contains the prefix it should return itself; if it doesn’t contain the prefix, it should return itself with the prefix added. For example: "pet".withPrefix("car") should return “carpet”.
Create a String extension that adds an isNumeric property that returns true if the string holds any sort of number. Tip: creating a Double from a String is a failable initializer.
Create a String extension that adds a lines property that returns an array of all the lines in a string. So, “this\nis\na\ntest” should return an array with four elements.
