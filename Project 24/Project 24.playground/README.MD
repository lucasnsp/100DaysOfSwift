Project 24 

In today’s technique project we’re going to zoom in on one specific detail of Swift programming: strings. Steve Jobs famously said “this is what customers pay us for: to sweat all these details so it's easy and pleasant for them to use our computers,” and strings are a good example of one of those details – they look like they ought to be simple, but if you want to get them right you need to spend some time working at it.

As you’ll see, there’s more to strings than just being a sequence of characters. In fact, Swift’s string handling is the most advanced I’ve seen in any language, and as a result if you play by Swift’s rules you’ll find your apps work great in every conceivable language – something that most developers for other languages need to work hard at.

Today you’re also going to learn an important skill that might cause you to go back and look through earlier projects for places you can use it: how to add formatting to your strings. This is done using a class called NSAttributedString, and although we’re only using it at an introductory level here as your skills progress you’ll learn how it can add images to strings – it’s really powerful!

Today you have four topics to work through, and you’ll learn about string subscripts, contains(where:), NSAttributedString, and more
