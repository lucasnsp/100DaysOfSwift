Project 29 

Today we’re starting another SpriteKit game, and although you will be learning new concepts such as destructible terrain and mixing UIKit and SpriteKit together, you’ll also get lots of practice with Core Graphics, physics and more.

At this point you might think you’re done with practicing that stuff: SpriteKit, physics, Core Graphics, and so on – that’s all easy, right? Well, there’s a quote so old no one is really sure who said it first, but I think it’s applicable here: “don’t practice until you get it right; practice until you can’t get it wrong.”

One of the goals in this series is to give you so much practice with the core fundamentals of app building that when it comes to you setting out to starting your own apps you’ll know exactly how to begin. That doesn’t mean you’ll know everything like the back of your hand, because no one can (or should!) memorize all this stuff. But at least you have a firm mental understanding of what’s possible, and you have and ever-increasing stash of your own code you can look back on as a reference for the future.

Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll learn how to generate a scene dynamically, how to connect SpriteKit and UIKit, and more.
