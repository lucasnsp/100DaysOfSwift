Project 29, part three

Challenge
1 - One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

2 - Add code and UI to track the player scores across levels, then make the game end after one player has won three times.
Add Auto Layout rules for the UI components in our storyboard, allowing them to remain positioned neatly regardless of which iPad size is used.

3 - Use the physics world’s gravity to add random wind to each level, making sure to add a label telling players the direction and strength.
