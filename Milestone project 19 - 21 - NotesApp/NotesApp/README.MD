Milestone Project 19-21 

Challenges completed :D.

Have you ever heard the phrase, “imitation is the highest form of flattery”? I can’t think of anywhere it’s more true than on iOS: Apple sets an extremely high standard for apps, and encourages us all to follow suit by releasing a vast collection of powerful, flexible APIs to work with.

Your challenge for this milestone is to use those API to imitate Apple as closely as you can: I’d like you to recreate the iOS Notes app. I suggest you follow the iPhone version, because it’s fairly simple: a navigation controller, a table view controller, and a detail view controller with a full-screen text view.

How much of the app you imitate is down to you, but I suggest you work through this list:

Create a table view controller that lists notes. Place it inside a navigation controller. (Project 1)
Tapping on a note should slide in a detail view controller that contains a full-screen text view. (Project 19)
Notes should be loaded and saved using Codable. You can use UserDefaults if you want, or write to a file. (Project 12)
Add some toolbar items to the detail view controller – “delete” and “compose” seem like good choices. (Project 4)
Add an action button to the navigation bar in the detail view controller that shares the text using UIActivityViewController. (Project 3)
