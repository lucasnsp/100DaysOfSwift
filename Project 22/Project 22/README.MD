Project 22 

We looked at MapKit back in project 16, and while maps work great for finding location at the large scale, they work much less well for small-scale location – when you’re inside buildings, or perhaps trying to measure distances in terms of centimeters.

The problem is that location matters. As Phyllis Schlafly said, “location is the key to most businesses, and the entrepreneurs typically build their reputation at a particular spot.” You’ve probably heard the saying “location, location, location”, which pretty much sums it up.

Well, today you’re going to learn about micro-location: the ability to detect very small distances between things, even when you’re inside. This is all made possible through Apple’s iBeacon technology, which are Bluetooth-powered devices that emit low-energy signals iOS can detect and act on.

The range is short – maybe 40 meters / 130 feet in a line of sight – but these devices use so little power that they can survive for years on a tiny battery. This makes them perfect for museums, schools, galleries, malls, and more.

Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll learn about Core Location, CLBeaconRegion, and more.
