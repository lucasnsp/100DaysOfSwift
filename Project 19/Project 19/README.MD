Started Project 19..


I completed the following challenges: 

ðŸ“š - Add a bar button item that lets users select from a handful of prewritten example scripts, shown using a UIAlertController â€“ at the very least your list should include the example we used in this project.



ðŸ“š - You're already receiving the URL of the site the user is on, so use UserDefaults to save the user's JavaScript for each site. You should convert the URL to a URL object in order to use its host property.



ðŸ“š - For something bigger, let users name their scripts, then select one to load using a UITableView. (NOT DONE)
