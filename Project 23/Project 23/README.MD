Project 23


Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

Try removing the magic numbers in the createEnemy() method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, giving them useful names.
Create a new, fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.
Add a “Game over” sprite node to the game scene when the player loses all their lives.
